The declaration statement for a function is referred to as a function prototype. Function 
prototypes allow the compiler to check for data type errors. The prototype for a function 
with empty parameter list requires either writing the keyword void or nothing. 
Ex: int display(void); A stub is the beginning of a final function, used as a placeholder 
until the final function is completed.
