The standard library consists of 15 header files. To include the library containing 
the desired function: #include <header-file-name>. Some examples of standard library 
functions are mathematical functions, random number generator function, character 
processing functions, etc. All C compilers provide two functions for creating random 
numbers: rand() and srand(), defined in the stdlib.h header file.
