Dynamic memory allocation: an alternative to fixed memory allocation in which memory space 
grows or diminishes during program execution. It is also known as run-time allocation. 
The function malloc() reserves the number of bytes requested by the argument passed to the function 
and returns the address of the first reserved location as an address of a void datatype, or NULL if 
sufficient memory is not available. calloc() reserves space for an array of n elements. It returns 
the address of the first reserved location and initializes all reserved bytes to 0s, or returns NULL 
if sufficient memory is not available.
