realloc() changes the size of previously allocated memory to  a new size. free() releases a 
block of bytes previously reserved. The malloc() and calloc() functions can be used interchangeably. 
The malloc(10*sizeof(char)) or calloc(10,sizeof(char)) requests enough memory to store 10 characters. 
Stack: special type of linked list in which objects can only be added to and removed from the 
top of the list. Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)list. Another important data structure that relies 
on linked structures is called a queue. It is a first in, first out (FIFO) structure. 
Enqueueing:placing a new item on top of the queue. Serving (dequeueing):removing an item from a queue.
